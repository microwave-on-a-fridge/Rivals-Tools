# HOW TO USE
### Replay extraction tool
To use the replay extraction tool, simply run `replays.bat`, and then input the drive letter for the drive you want the replays to be copied to. Don't know what a drive letter is? In Windows, different drives/drive partitions are organized by a letter. For example, the boot drive that the operating system uses to boot and contains all the critical Windows system files is commonly the `C:` drive, and most other drives are in alphabetical order after `C:`, e.g. `D:` `E:` `F:` `G:`, etc. The reason the `A:` and `B:` drive letters are skipped is because those are assigned to floppy disk drives, but since modern computers don't have floppy drives anymore, it skips straight to `C:` (the letter assigned to the first hard disk partition by default).
